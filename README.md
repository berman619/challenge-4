# 04 Web APIs: Timed Coding Quiz

## Description

As part of the Columbia Coding Boot Camp, I was tasked with creating a timed coding quiz on JavaScript fundamentals to implement learnings from the Web APIs unit. I developed a five-question quiz with a 60-second timer. The timer deducts 10 seconds for each incorrect answer. The website displays a message after each answer is submitted noting if it was correct or incorrect. Upon completion, the user is prompted to save their score to a high scores list, and that score is stored to local storage. 

While completing this project, I referenced materials from the Columbia Coding Boot Camp, MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, JavaScript.info, and StackOverflow.
